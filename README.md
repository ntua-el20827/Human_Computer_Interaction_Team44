# ArtVenture Flutter App (Demo Version)
Welcome to ArtVenture, your artistic adventure companion! This is a demo version of the Flutter app designed to engage users in creative challenges, allowing them to explore their artistic abilities and earn points along the way. Please note that this demo version utilizes dummy data in the database.

- Features

Challenges:
Challenges are stored in our database, filled with dummy data for demonstration purposes.
To showcase challenges, we've implemented different-sized cards:
Small Cards (Compact display for a quick overview) / Medium Cards (Balanced size, providing more information without overwhelming the user) / Big Cards (Prominent display with additional space.Two buttons with dynamic text and behavior based on the challenge's page and state)

Events:
Explore artistic events displayed on the map.
Discover exciting art-related activities near you.

- Implementation Notes

Challenges play a central role in the app, serving as a bridge between users and their creative journey.
Utilize the challenge states (open, in progress, done) to enhance user engagement.
Leverage the versatility of challenge cards to present information in a visually appealing manner.
Demo Version Details:
This is a demo version, and the database is pre-populated with dummy data for demonstration purposes. The full version of ArtVenture will require a server to store actual data for Events and Challenges.
